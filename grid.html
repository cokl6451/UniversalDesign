    <h2>Rainbow Trout Poetic Description</h2>
    <p>In waters clear and streams so brisk,
        The rainbow trout does leap and frisk.
        With scales that mirror skies so grand,
        A prism's dance upon wet sand.
        
        In depths where silent currents flow,
        It glides where lesser fishes slow,
        A flash of pink, a dash of gold,
        A beauty in the river's hold.
        
        It weaves through rocks with such finesse,
        Adorned in nature's vibrant dress.
        A spectacle of life so bright,
        Beneath the sun's warm, gleaming light.
        
        With every swift and graceful bout,
        The world seems right, no room for doubt.
        Oh, rainbow trout in streams so clear,
        Your splash is music to the ear.</p>

    <h2>Brown Trout Poetic Description</h2>
    <p>In the stream's great ballet, a spectacle stinky,
        Wallow the brown trout, rather kooky and dinky.
        No gleam in their swim, no wit in their flick,
        Just bumbling trout with their presence so thick.
        
        They linger in shadows, in silt they do wallow,
        With brains full of pebbles, they're tough to swallow.
        While we dance in the light, with brilliance we think,
        Theyâ€™re just the old brown trout, that truly do stink.</p>
