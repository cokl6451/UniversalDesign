                            Taking steps to create an accessible environment isn't just the right AND legal thing to do, it is also the most intelligent business decision. 
                            Millions of individuals are affected by disabilities worldwide, and unless there's some medical break through, that number will only increase.
                            For example, in the 2022 census the number of people over 80 years old increased by 25% since the 2016 census. Not only will accessible design allow brands to tap into this audience, 
                            it also gives this target audience the opportunity to connect with the world. One of the most important aspects of a society is the ability to work together, 
                            and by creating an accessible environment, we are allowing everyone to contribute to the world.
